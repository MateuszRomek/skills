# How

Explore the codebase to answer "how does X work?" questions. Produce clear architectural explanations at the level of a senior engineer onboarding onto a subsystem. Enough to build a working mental model, not annotated source code.

Two modes:

1. **Explain** (default). Explore the codebase and produce a clear explanation
2. **Critique.** Explain first, then dispatch the configured independent architectural review roster

## Explain Mode

### Step 1. Understand the Question and Assess Complexity

Parse what the user is asking about:

- "How does the rate limiter work?", a subsystem
- "How do we handle billing for on-demand usage?", a feature flow
- "How is the auth service structured?", an architectural overview
- "Walk me through what happens when a user submits a form", a runtime trace

Identify the scope. If ambiguous, state your best-guess interpretation before exploring. Don't ask. Let the user redirect if you're off.

Resolve execution through [`HOST-COMPATIBILITY.md`](../../agent-mode/HOST-COMPATIBILITY.md). Decompose the question into the distinct exploration angles needed to trace the subsystem without duplicating work. The number of semantic angles follows the code shape; it never determines the worker roster. Example split for "how does the rate limiter work?":

- Explorer 1: data model and state management
- Explorer 2: request path and enforcement
- Explorer 3: configuration and metrics infrastructure

Dispatch those units as `how-explorer`. Its `partition` semantics distribute the units across no more than the setup-owned roster. Keep delegated workers read-only and pass any descendant budget reserved for their branch.

Each explorer gets the same base prompt from `references/explorer-prompt.md` plus a specific exploration angle naming its slice. Each explorer should:
- Start broad: Glob for relevant directories, Grep for key types/interfaces/class names
- Follow the thread: from an entry point, trace the call chain (callers, callees, data flow, type definitions)
- Read the actual code, don't guess from file names
- Stop when it can describe the full path from input to output (or trigger to effect) without hand-waving any step
- Note things that are surprising, non-obvious, or that a newcomer would get wrong

Each explorer returns structured findings: components found, flow traced, files read, anything non-obvious. Overlap between explorers is fine; the explainer reconciles.

### Step 3. Explain and synthesize

After exploration, dispatch one shared explanation brief as `how-explainer`. Include all findings and use `references/explainer-prompt.md`. Each resolved worker reconciles overlaps and contradictions into the output format below. The coordinator owns the final explanation and reconciles multiple returned drafts when the configured roster contains them. If the profile keeps this role in the coordinator, the coordinator performs the same contract directly.

### Step 4. Present

Present the explainer's output to the user. You may lightly edit for clarity or add context from the conversation, but don't substantially rewrite. The explainer's communication is the product.

### Output Format

Follow this structure, adapted to the question. Not every section is needed for every question.

**Overview.** 1-2 paragraphs. What it is, what it does, why it exists. Enough to decide whether to keep reading.

**Key Concepts.** The important types, services, or abstractions. Brief definition of each. Not exhaustive, just the ones needed to understand the rest.

**How It Works.** The core of the explanation. Walk through the flow: what triggers it, what happens step by step, where data goes, the decision points. Prose, not pseudocode. Reference specific files and functions so the reader can go look, but don't dump code blocks unless a snippet is genuinely necessary.

**Where Things Live.** A brief map of the relevant files/directories. Not every file, just the ones needed to start working in this area.

**Gotchas.** Non-obvious or surprising things that would trip someone up. Historical context that explains why something looks weird. Known sharp edges.

## Critique Mode

Triggered when the user asks for architectural issues, problems, or improvements, not just understanding.

### Step 1. Explain First

Run the full explain flow above (Steps 1-4). You must understand the architecture before critiquing it.

### Step 2. Dispatch Critics

After the explanation is complete, dispatch one shared critique brief as `how-critics`. Its configured roster is complete: do not resize it, replace assignments, inherit, or escalate reasoning. Keep every resolved worker read-only.

Read `references/critic-prompt.md` for the prompt template. Each critic gets:
1. The explanation from Step 1 (so they don't re-explore)
2. The relevant file paths (so they can read the actual code)
3. The architectural critique rubric from `references/critique-rubric.md`

### Step 3. Lead Judgment

Same framework as the interrogate skill. You're a pragmatic lead, not an aggregator.

Categorize findings:
- **Act on.** Architectural problems worth fixing now
- **Consider.** Real concerns, but the cost/benefit is unclear
- **Noted.** Valid observations, low priority
- **Dismissed.** Wrong, missing context, or style preference

Present the explanation first (from Step 1), then the critique verdict below it. The explanation should stand on its own; someone who just wants to understand the system shouldn't wade through critique.
