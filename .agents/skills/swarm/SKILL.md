# Swarm

Dispatch semantic work through the setup-owned `swarm-worker` route. Workers may cover separate slices or receive a shared race brief. The coordinator waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the semantic shape: distinct coverage slices or one shared race brief. For a race, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before dispatch.
3. Dispatch `swarm-worker` through [`HOST-COMPATIBILITY.md`](../../agent-mode/HOST-COMPATIBILITY.md). Setup owns its roster, assignments, and limits; the skill never derives them from the shape.
4. Give each resolved worker its own writable output when it writes. Use a worktree, branch, or distinct `/tmp/swarm-<slug>/worker-<label>/`.

## Phase B: Fan out

The current coordinator schedules the resolved roster within its configured depth and reserved task budget. Use the current local workspace by default. Use a remote environment only when the user requests it or local execution cannot satisfy the task. Include any descendant budget reserved for each worker.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence.

If a worker drops out, continue with the returned results and note it. Do not replace the worker.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
